<H1>Pull Parser 2 Overview</H2><P>

<H2>New features since previous version</H2>

<P>It is a major revision of previous 1.1 version.

<ul>
<li>
clean separation between interfaces and implementation - alternative
implementations of  XPP2 interfaces are now possible and can be easily
integrated thanks to JAXP-like pluggablity
(user source code won't need to change at all!)
<li>
contains two ultra lightweight Java XML tree representation:
XmlNode must be constructed before used
but XmlPullNode allows for combined pull parsing and incremental tree
construction with ability to skip parts of tree and dynamically modify
its content (allow to store _any_ object).
<li>
J2ME MIDP support and samples (standard XppCount sample with the same
implementation shared between J2ME Midlet and command line J2SE version)
<li>
sample that shows XML node tree of XML file in SWING tree
<li>
allow users to access underlying buffer parser
(to avoid creating String to represent element content)
<li>
added interfaces to record and format XML output
<li>it is faster by 10% than previous Pull Parser 1.1
<li>
whole jar archive containing interfaces and implementation is just 40K
(including tree node handling)
<li>
some small bug fixes and improvements to tokenizer and parser
</ul>
