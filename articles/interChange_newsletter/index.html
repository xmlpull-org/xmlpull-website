<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Today, there are basically two major libraries for accessing XML documents
in Java: SAX and DOM. If an application needs to process 
XML documents quickly and with little memory overhead, SAX is the popular 
choice. SAX is suited for streaming parsing since, in 
contrast to DOM, it does not need build and keep a whole XML tree in memory. 
However there are other alternatives to DOM and SAX such as JDOM and DOM4J that 
are more lightweight versions of DOM that in contrast to DOM are specialized to 
Java only (DOM is programming language independent and has bindings to many 
languages). However in this article we will concentrate on streaming parsing and 
ignore document object model APIs (such as DOM, JDOM and DOM4J).<p>During streaming 
parsing events corresponding to XML Infoset are reported to the application when
observed, and then "forgotten" by the parser. When using SAX it is up to the
application to register callback methods for the different event
types (such as start 
tag and text content), and if needed to build a custom in-memory representation of processed XML 
input. This kind of parsing, where events are delivered to the application through 
callback methods is called <b>push parsing</b>. 

<p>However there exist another way to  communicate XML events to 
application: <b>pull parsing</b>. The crucial difference between push 
parsing and pull parsing is how events are delivered to the application. The processing model 
in pull parsing is  similar to using classes from the java.io package. For example, FileReader or DataInputStream provide methods to 
read input, and the methods block until the desired input is available. Typical 
methods such as FileReader.read() and DataInputStream.readBoolean() read a few 
bytes of input and return them to application.<p>We believe that the same 
approach should be applied to XML parsing and hence we both have created our own 
pull parser implementations (kXML1 and XPP1/2), which we recently integrated 
into a <i>Common API for XML Pull Parsing</i> (in short XmlPull API). The motivation 
for switching from the push to a pull model was that the callback method 
registered with a push parser can quickly become a bottleneck. Independent of 
the parsing state,&nbsp; the same callback methods
are always called, and the  code inside callback methods tends to look like a giant case statement
instead of a structured program. We hope to demonstrate advantages of push 
parsing by using following two examples and asking our readers to consider how 
equivalent examples would look when programmed using SAX. </p>

<h2>A Simple Example</h2>

<p>We would like to with a simple example to give a flavor of what pull parsing 
looks like. Imagine a list of phones stored in XML. A sample XML file could look 
like this:</p>
<p>&lt;phone-list xmlns=&quot;http://example.com/2002/phone-list&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;phone type=&quot;work&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;phone-number&gt;333.3333&lt;/phone-number&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;/phone&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;phone type=&quot;fax&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;phone-number&gt;444.4444&lt;/phone-number&gt;<br>
&nbsp; &lt;/phone&gt;<br>
&lt;/phone-list&gt;<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now let us assume that we want to convert this XML into a list of Phone objects,
where each phone item is represented as a simple Java Bean:</p>

<pre>  public class Phone {
      private String type;
      private String phoneNumber;

      public void setType(String type) { this.type = type;}
      public String getType() { return type; }
      public void setPhoneNumber(String phoneNumber) { this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber; }
      public String getPhoneNumber() { return phoneNumber; }
  }
</pre>

<p>You will probably agree that the following pseudo code would do the parsing a natural and straightforward 
task: </p>

<pre>  <b><i>Vector phoneList = new Vector</i></b>();
  move input to &lt;phone-list> start element
  while(true) {
    <b>get next event</b>
    if (event is end element and has name 'phone-list') break;
    if (event is not start element) signal error
    if (start element has name different than "phone") signal error
    <b><i>Phone phone = new Phone();</i></b>
    <b><i>phone.setType</i></b>( get value of attribute named 'type' from current element )
    <b>read next start element skipping any precedent white spaces</b>
    if( the next event is not start element ) signal an error
    if( element name is not 'phone-number') signal error
    <b><i>phone.setPhoneNumber</i></b>( <b>read text content of current element</b> )
    <b>move to end element</b> 'phone-number'
    <b>move to end element</b> 'phone'
    <b><i>phoneList.add</i></b>(phone);
  }
  check that input is on &lt;/phone-list> end element
</pre>

<p>The purpose of this code is to extract enough information from XML to provide 
arguments for <b><i>setType()</i></b> and <b><i>setPhoneNumber()</i></b> methods. Parts of code that are 
responsible for creating and managing list of phone numbers are marked in <i><b>
bold-italic</b></i>.</p>


<p>In <b>bold</b>, we have marked operations that we want the parser to perform. 
These operations essentially move a logical cursor forward through the XML input. 
Actually, a parser works like a cursor that moves through the XML 
content, and in this respect it is very similar to iterating the elements  of a JDBC ResultSet. However, in contrast to table rows, the items 
that are enumerated may have different types (start tags, element content, 
processing instructions).</p>


<p>Now, let's look at an implementation of the above example that uses the
XmlPull API (available <a href="http://www.xmlpull.org/">http://www.xmlpull.org</a>). 
The pseudo code from the example is inserted as comments, in order to illustrate 
what the XmlPull calls are doing. Calls to <b>
require</b> corresponds to if() checks from pseudo code. If correctness checking 
is not required then the calls to require() can be removed.</p>

<pre>        final String NS_URI = &quot;http://example.com/2002/phone-list&quot;;
        Vector phoneList = new Vector();
        //move input to <phone-list> start element
        parser.<b>next</b>();
        parser.require(parser.START_TAG, NS_URI, "phone-list");
        while(true) {
            //get the next event and signal an error if the next event is not a start or end tag
            parser.<b>nextTag</b>();

            //if (event is end element and has name 'phone-list') break;
            if(parser.<b>getEventType</b>() == parser.END_TAG) break;

            //if (event is not start element) signal error
            //if (start element has no name "phone") signal error
            parser.<b>require</b>(parser.START_TAG, NS_URI, "phone");

            Phone phone = new Phone();

            // phone.setType( get value of attribute named 'type' from current element )
            phone.setType( parser.getAttributeValue("", "type") );

            //read next start element skipping precedent white spaces; 
            parser.nextTag();
            			
            //if (the next event is not start element) </phone-list><phone-list>signal an error   </phone-list><phone-list>
            //if (element name is not 'phone-number') signal error
            parser.require(parser.START_TAG, NS_URI, "phone-number");

            // phone.setPhoneNumber( read text content of current element)
            // move to end element 'phone-number'
            phone.setPhoneNumber( parser.<b>nextText</b>() );

            // nextText() has already moved the parser to END_TAG
            parser.require(parser.END_TAG, NS_URI, "phone-number");

            // move to end element 'phone'
            parser.<b>nextTag</b>();

            parser.require(parser.END_TAG, NS_URI, "phone");
            phoneList.add(phone);
        }

        //check that input is on </phone-list> end element
        parser.require(parser.END_TAG, NS_URI, "phone-list");

        // print the collected list of phone numbers
        for (int i = 0; i < phoneList.size(); i++) {
            Phone phone = (Phone) phoneList.get(i);
            System.out.println("phone number="+phone.getPhoneNumber()+" type="+phone.getType());
        }

</pre>
<p>The complete code including sample data  is available online at
<a href="http://www.xmlpull.org/articles/interChange_newsletter/phone_list/">
http://www.xmlpull.org/articles/interChange_newsletter/phone_list/</a>. To 
compile and run example make sure to get the latest <a href="http://www.kxml.org/">kXML2</a> or
<a href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/xpp/mxp1/">XPP3/MXP1</a> and 
put  jar file with XML parser in your CLASSPATH. Note also that example code must 
be saved to a subdirectory corresponding to package name - in this case phone_list. </p>

<p>When the example is executed, it produces following output:</p>
<pre>phone number=333.3333 type=work
phone number=444.4444 type=fax</pre>

<p>This example could be easily extended to handle an address book. For 
interested readers we have created such extended sample available at
<a href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/~aslom/xml/databinding/jaxme-xmlpull/">
http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/~aslom/xml/databinding/jaxme-xmlpull/</a>. We 
have made available both code generated by JAXME that uses SAX to parse address 
book XML and equivalent code that uses XmlPull API. This should make easy to 
compare both push and pull parsing approaches to do more complex tasks. </p>

<h3>Short summary</h3>

<p>The "core" of the XmlPull API is a small set of cursor related operations 
 
derived from analysis of pull parsing use cases such as the one showed above:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>next</b>() will return the next available event: END_DOCUMENT to signal 
  end of input, START_TAG to signal a start element, END_TAG to 
  signal an end element and TEXT when the parser has read element 
  content (those are all events that can be returned by next())</li>
  
  <li><b>nextTag</b>() will skip any white spaces, then call next() and return 
  START_TAG or END_TAG. For other event types, it will signal an error</li>

  <li><b>getEventType</b>() returns the type of the current event, 
  	(START_TAG, TEXT, etc.), as returned by the previous cursor
  		operation</li>

  <li><b>require(expectedState, expectedNamespace, expectedName)</b> is an 
  &quot;assert&quot; function that can be used to check whether the parser state 
  correspond to what is expected by user application</li>

  <li><b>nextText</b>() will read and return text content or throw 
   an exception if the current element has mixed content</li>
</ul>


<h2>Recursive Parsing</h2>

<p>While our first example shows the simplicity of the
XmlPull API, the main advantages of XmlPull parsing 
become visible when parsing recursive structures.</p>

<p>The following XML code shows the input data for a
simple yes/no game:</p>

<pre>&lt;question text='Is it round?'>
 &lt;question text='Is it bright?'>
  &lt;answer>It is the Sun!&lt;/answer>
  &lt;answer>It is a ball!&lt;/answer>
 &lt;/question>
 &lt;answer>I do not know!&lt;/answer>
&lt;/question>
</pre>

<p>In order to represent the tree and the
program logic, we can use the following Java 
class:</p>

<pre>public class Node {
    private String text;
    private Node yes;  // if null, it's an answer
    private Node no;
    
    Node(String answer) {
        this.text = answer;
    }
    
    Node(String question, Node yes, Node no) {
        this.text = question;
        this.yes = yes;
        this.no = no;        
    }
    
    void run () throws IOException {
       
        if (yes == null) 
            System.out.println ("Answer: "+text);
        else {
            System.out.println (text+ " (y/n)");    

            while (true) {
                int i = System.in.read();
                if (i == 'y' || i == 'Y') {
                    yes.run();
                    break;
                }
                else if (i == 'n' || i == 'N') {
                    no.run();            
                    break;
                }
            }
        }                
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Now, how do we build the Node tree from the XML input?
For a conventional SAX parser, we would need to implement
the startElement(), endElement() and characters() callback methods. In these methods, we would need to look up the
current parsing state before we could handle the event.
Thus, we would need an explicit state model, including
a stack containing information if we are in the 
"yes" or "no" branch for each level. Further, we need
to store the finished nodes that are needed to assemble 
the higher level nodes.</p>

<p>Using the XmlPull API, it is possible to use recursive 
functions to let the program state exactly reflect the current
parsing state in a natural way. Thus, a complex 
explicit state model is not required. Instead, we just
build two methods, parseAnswer() and
parseQuestion(), for both node types, and a third method, parseNode(), which calls parseAnswer() or parseQuestion()
depending on the current start tag:

<ul>
<li>parseAnswer() reads the answer text and returns a corresponding
	Node object</li>
<li>parseQuestion() reads the question text attribute and calls
	parseNode() twice to obtain the yes and no branches. From this information, 
a question node is built and returned
<li>parseNode() calls parseAnswer() or paseQuestion() depending
    on the current start tag, and returns the corresponding
    Node object</li>
</ul>

<p>The following listing shows the complete XmlPull
based implementation of these tree methods. This is all
you need to parse the example node  structure with
the XmlPull API:</p>

<pre>    public static Node parseAnswer(XmlPullParser p) throws IOException, XmlPullParserException {
        p.require(p.START_TAG, "", "answer");
        Node result = new Node (p.nextText());
        p.require(p.END_TAG, "", "answer");
        return result;
    }

    public static Node parseQuestion(XmlPullParser p) throws IOException, XmlPullParserException {
        p.require(p.START_TAG, "", "question");
        String text = p.getAttributeValue("", "text");
        Node yes = parseNode (p);
        Node no = parseNode (p);
        p.nextTag();
        p.require(p.END_TAG, "", "question");
        return new Node (text, yes, no);
    }

    public static Node parseNode (XmlPullParser p) throws IOException, XmlPullParserException {
        p.nextTag ();
        p.require(p.START_TAG, "", null);
        if (p.getName().equals("question"))
            return parseQuestion(p);
        else 
            return parseAnswer(p);       
    }
</pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>


<p>Pull parsing approach to process XML is gradually gaining popularity. 
Microsoft .NET already contains set of APIs that are enabling XML pull parsing. 
However Java does not have such standard API. We have combined our experience to 
create one <i>Common API for XML Pull Parsing</i> that is currently available with 
three implementations: very small size and small memory footprint that is best 
suited for J2ME (kXML2), small size and high performance (XPP3/MXP1) and fully 
XML standards compliant that uses Xerces 2 parser. We are also working 
in JSR 173 expert group that was formed to create streaming pull-parsing API 
for XML for future versions of Java.</p>


<p>We hope that we have made a convincing case for XML pull parsing and that the 
examples served as simple introduction to what can be done with XML pull 
parsing. Of course, the final decision to use pull parsing must be made separately 
for each project but knowing about pull parsing will give developers more 
choices (and essentially more tools in their arsenal to deal with XML).</p>
